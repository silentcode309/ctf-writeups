# Juice Shop – SSTI (Angular Expression Injection)
Category: Template Injection (CSTI)  
Difficulty: Easy  
Platform: OWASP Juice Shop  
Date: 2025-__

## Summary
This challenge demonstrates a Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI) vulnerability in the **Customer Feedback** feature of OWASP Juice Shop.  
The application passes user-controlled input into Angular’s templating engine without sanitization, allowing expressions inside `{{ }}` to be evaluated in the browser context.

This exposure can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution and full DOM access if chained with other flaws.

- It accepts user-submitted comments.
- It immediately renders those comments back into the page.
- The rendering uses Angular binding, which is known to allow `{{ }}` expressions if unsanitized.

To confirm reflection, I submitted a benign test value:
